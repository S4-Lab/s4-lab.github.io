### Wireless Sensing Systems for Environmental Monitoring
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">
Environmental monitoring has become increasingly relevant due to climate change, however deploying sensor solutions in harsh environments such as oceans, forests, and rural agriculture is challenging. In these scenarios, we need to monitor areas that can span 10s of thousands of acres and lack connectivity and power infrastructure. Developing energy-efficient and cost-effictive sensing and wireless connectivity solutions is needed in order to enable long-term and seamless data collection for applications ranging from data-driven agriculture to ocean profiling and animal ecology. In the S4 lab we focus on solving the aforementioned challenges by developing new types of wireless sensing systems for environmental applications. 

Our work includes research efforts such as FarmBeats, an end-to-end AI and IoT system for data-driven agriculture, which is now a product of Azure Marketplace. As well as new efforts related to ocean IoT and wildlife monitoring.

### New Methods of Wireless Communication
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
Low-power wireless communication, such as backscatter, has played a critical role in enabling battery-free sensing. Compared to conventional wireless communication methods, backscatter communication is orders of magnitude less power-consuming because the transmitting device (or tag) does not need to generate a carrier signal and instead reflects and absorbs an existing signal in order to modulate information bits. This existing signal can be a generated RF source (e.g., RFID) or an ambient RF source (e.g., TV or FM broadcast signal). A drawback with existing backscatter communication solutions is their dependence on a nearby RF source. In the S4 lab, we are interested in developing new backscatter communication techniques that can be enabled nearly anywhere. These efforts include thermal backscatter, where thermal noise, such as Johnson noise, can be modulted to wirelessly transmit bits of information without the use of a generated or ambient RF source. More recent efforts include satellite backscatter, where we demonstrate that existing satellite infrastructure can be utilized to enable long-range connectivity in remote and resource-constrained areas.

### Wearable Devices for Women's Health &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
Womens health has been historically underrepresented in medical studies thus leading to a shortage of data that accurately represents women. With the growth peronsal wearable devices, we see an opportunity to expand womens understanding of their personal health as well as develop a stronger base of data for womens health research. Our current projects are focused on wearable devices for mothers, in particularly for measuring lacation.
