<br>
In the S4 Lab, we invent sensor systems, which includes developing new methods of wireless communication, energy harvesting, sensing, and energy-efficient computing. Our research has applications in the domains of ubiquitous computing, robotics, and bioelectronics. Current research efforts include developing energy-efficient wireless sensing systems for environmental monitoring, new methods of low-power satellite connectivity, energy-efficient computing for resource constrained embedded systems, and wearables for human health.
